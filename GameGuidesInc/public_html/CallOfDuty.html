            <h1>Maneuverability is Key</h1>
            <br>
            It's essential to master wall-running, sliding, and thrust-jumping, as it greatly improves your ability to traverse the environment, which in turn makes you a harder target to hit. For instance, wall-running and thrust-jumping can throw off enemy fire, while sliding can be used to quickly zip into cover. Take the time to understand how each of these actions affect your mobility, as performing them recklessly is likely to get you killed.

            <h1>Don't Forget About the Radar, Seriously</h1>
            <br>
            Always keep an eye on your radar. This might seem like a given, but beginners often forget it even exists. The radar is an incredibly useful tool that reveals both ally and enemy locations.

            <h1>Picking the Right Combat Rig</h1>
            <br>
            Infinite Warfare sports a new class system called Combat Rigs, which are special classes you can choose that each offer its own distinct weapons and abilities. Below you can find a brief rundown of each Rig:
            <br>
            FTL: A class better suited for those who like to be sneaky and flank enemies.
            <br>
            Merc: An ideal choice for defensive players. Capable of heavy suppression fire.
            <br>
            Warfighter: Well-rounded class suited for those accustomed to the traditional Call of Duty run-and-gun playstyle.
            <br>
            Stryker: A support-class fighter that deals solid area-of-effect damage.
            <br>
            Phantom: A sniper with an assortment of long-range weapons and concealment options.
            <br>
            Synaptic: A scrapper built for speed and close quarters combat.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Don't be Afraid to Try Combat Rigs Outside Your Comfort Zone</h1>
            <br>
            With six different Combat Rigs to choose from, it's easy to stick to one you're comfortable with. However, each Combat Rig has their own unique weapons and abilities that make them fully capable of wracking up a large string of kills. While a Combat Rig may not suit your playstyle, it's best to experiment with each one. A greater understanding of each makes you a better player overall, as it not only enhances your knowledge of what each can do, but how each can counter others.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Spend Your Keys Wisely (and in the Right Mode)</h1>
            <br>
            As you play the various multiplayer modes, you'll start to earn a currency called Keys. These can be used to purchase Supply Drops, which are loot boxes that net you a set of three random items, which include prototype weapons, Combat Rig items, and personalization colors. Supply Drops can be purchased in both multiplayer and Zombies, but it's worth noting that the latter devotes one of the three items you earn to a pack of Zombie mode cards. If you don't play Zombies, make sure to spend your Keys exclusively in multiplayer, as doing otherwise will only be a waste in the long run.

            <h1>Accomplish Unit Objectives</h1>
            <br>
            New to Infinite Warfare is the addition of Mission Teams, which are special groups you can join that give you objectives to complete during a match. Accomplishing these objectives earns you perks, Combat Rig paintjobs, and prototype weapons that are each unique to your Mission Team. Make sure to accomplish your team's current unit objective whenever possible; the rewards you unlock are worth your time.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Lob n' Spray</h1>
            <br>
            Unlike past Call of Duty games, Infinite Warfare lets you lob grenades with your left arm, allowing you to continue firing your weapon during a throwing animation. Be sure to take advantage of this, as it can be a handy way to cover yourself while throwing a cooked grenades towards a group of baddies.
            <br>

            <br>
            <h1>Invest in Prototype Weapons</h1>
            <br>
            Prototype Weapons are some of the strongest weapons in the game, so it's best to get your hands on as many as you can. Similar to Destiny's weapons, they come in tiers: common, rare, legendary, and epic. You can acquire these weapons by crafting them with salvage (which you earn by playing or trading in items), opening up Supply Drops, or by leveling your faction.

            <h1>Pay Attention to the Timer in Defender</h1>
            <br>
            When playing Defender, pay attention to the timer. Depending on the situation and your placement on the map, the timer can determine the best course-of-action. For example, if the timer is nearly up and the enemy with the ball is far away, try seeking out the ball's next spawn point instead of pursuing. It helps to be methodical about flow of the match, as opposed to mindlessly following the ball wherever it goes.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Don't be Afraid to Hide in Defender</h1>
            <br>
            Don't hesitate to shamelessly hide when you've got the ball in Defender. There's no need to pull off over-the-top maneuvers; you're sometimes better off finding a place to hide and sticking there as the timer goes down. If you can't find a spot, stay with your teammates and keep moving away from the enemy team.
