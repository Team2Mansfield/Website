            <h1>Welcome to the Primary Classes Guide for Battlefield 1.</h1>

                <br>
                Hi, I go by the gaming name “olboygamer”; you may not have heard of me but I’ve been around gaming for ages and I now spend my time saving lives by helping beginner gamers in particular get to become dominators and masters at their games.
                <br>
                On this page I will give you an overview or each of the 4 main or primary Classes that you need to choose from when you’re getting setup in Multiplayer mode playing Battlefield 1.
                <br>
                For beginners, this page will give you a good general overview of the Classes in Battlefield 1 Multiplayer. After reading this page, you will have a much better understanding of the basics. This page will lead you via the hyperlinks to pages that explain in much more detail each of the Classes and the weapons that each class has available for you to choose from.
                <br>
                Battlefield 1 supremacy tactics take time to learn and the beginner should be aware that the choices you make with selecting your Classes and the weaponry that each class offers is paramount in your survival on the battlefield.
                <br>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <br>
                <h1>The Assault Class:</h1>
                <br>
                The Assault class is your anti-vehicle class.
                <br>
                What is an Anti-Vehicle Class, I hear you ask? Players who select the Assault Class are the only ones who can select weapons from an arsenal of high explosives, specifically designed to destroy all types of vehicles and, your personal primary weapons to choose from are Shotguns or sub-machine guns. Because these weapons are only good for short to medium range combat, your game style will need to be suited to close quarters action.
                <br>
                One of the reasons you might select the Assault Class is your preference to staying inside buildings away from snipers or someone with a long-range rifle.
                <br>
                If you like to take out tanks, then this class should also be on your list. There is a good range of anti-tank grenades available.
                <br>
                Advice from the olboygamer: If you choose to use the Assault Class, keep yourself in buildings and covered spaces and keep away from open areas. When armoured vehicles get into enclosed spaces, put your anti-tank grenades to good use but remember you will do better against the tanks if you work with other players in the same class. Above all else, remember you are at a serious disadvantage with your shotguns and sub-machine guns out in the open.
                <br>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <br>
                <h1>The Medic Class:</h1>
                <br>
                The Medic Class players are the only ones that can revive people on the battlefield.
                <br>
                Choosing the Medic Class in Battlefield 1 might not be appealing to many players, but it does have some rather good weapons options that make a player just as formidable on the battlefield as any of the other classes. The semi-automatic rifles available in the Armoury work really well in medium range combat situations.
                <br>
                Given most of the fire-fights you will get into on the battlefield, will be at the medium range, this class offers weapons that are best for you in this combat range. The Medic Class is the go-to class for medium range fighting. Put a good scope on your rifle or choose a rifle with a decent iron sight and you’ll dominate on the battlefield, providing you can shoot of course.
                <br>
                olboygamer says: Choose to use the Medic Class if you’re a team player, all teams need at least one Medic Class player. Remember, the main priority of a medic is to make sure your teammates are well stocked with first aid supplies and that any team member downed can be revived. Be sure to use the DICE feature that has added to Battlefield 1 which allows downed players to call out for medics. Also, there is a rifle-grenade that works as a personal noob tube, it’s fun to use and handy for breaking through walls to get to downed team-members or to get them and yourself to safety.
                <br>
                It’s not only beginners that need help to get their class setup right, are you having trouble? Check out the BF1 Dominator Guide here – it explains in detail how to set yourself up properly to dominate in any Battlefield 1 Class on the battlefield. This guide is an invaluable resource for BF1 players of any skill level.
                <br>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <br>
                <h1>The Scout Class:</h1>
                <br>
                This is your long-range sniper class; a Scout comes armed with all manner of high powered rifles.
                <br>
                If you’re the patient type of gamer, not too keen on being in the short or medium range battlefield positions, the Scout Class is probably for you. As a Scout Class player, your likely to be found perched in an upstairs window waiting for an opponent to come into view. You may also be the sniper on a hilltop taking aim from above the battlefield.
                <br>
                Scout Class in Battlefield 1 is not to dissimilar to other Battlefield games, in that it is equipped with a good range of Sniper rifles, it also comes with various traps, like Tripwires, that can be placed to secure an area.
                <br>
                A word of advice from the olboygamer: Your biggest threat will be enemy snipers and tanks. Seek out and eliminate enemy snipers and use flares to alert teammates of an enemy’s location. One more thing, have a decent sidearm you feel comfortable with. The side-arm you choose is a very important decision. Your sniper’s rifle is useless in close quarters combat.
                <br>
                With regards to the threat from tanks, keep an eye out for the give-away scope glint and make your squad aware of the tank threat.
                <br>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <br>
                <h1>The Support Class:</h1>
                <br>
                A Support Class player is the heavy weapons expert in Battlefield 1. These players are the only ones who can stash ammo containers for allies to refill their ammo.
                <br>
                The support class player operates similarly to the medic, as their role is to provide support by helping teammates survive on the battlefield. Medics stick needles in players to revive them, support class players drop ammo cashes ensuring teammates have all the firepower they need.
                <br>
                When playing the longer game modes in Battlefield 1 such as conquest and operations, you’ll often find yourself short on ammo and this is where like with medics, you need to have Support Class players on your team.
                <br>
                Your Support Class primary weapon is an LMG (Light Machine Gun), giving you great close to medium range capabilities to support other fighters and take care of yourself.
                <br>
                The olboygamer’s advice: The support class is there to help and provide ammo and support for the advancing soldiers. You’re not out there to be the hero. You don’t have the weapons for that style of battlefield action. Remember; to take advantage of the tripwire bomb, the claymore of the Great War and be a helping hand for snipers holed up in a building or bunker. You’ve also got mortars, so use them for effectively dislodging snipers from their hideouts.
                <br>

                <h1>Summary of the Battlefield 1 Classes</h1>
                <br>
                For the beginner, Classes in Battlefield 1 can be a little daunting or difficult to work out what is best for your style of game, they aren’t as cut-and-dried as in earlier Battlefield games but whether you have had experience with those games or not, the Battlefield 1 games weaponry will still take some time to get used to.
                <br>
                The 4 primary classes in Battlefield 1 are each suited to a particular style of play or team role, however each class’s weaponry options provide the games player with the necessaries to defend themselves in a variety of situations. By that I mean, the weapons you have the choice of selecting from are quite able to protect you in most situation on the battlefield providing you have the skill to use them effectively.
                <br>
