            <h1>For Honor</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Start with the AI</h1>
            <br>
            No really, start with the AI. I am far more inclined to compare this combat system to Street Fighter than to Dark Souls.  Each class has combos, and to be effective you must know your class’s combos. AI 1v1 duels are a great way to get that initial learning curve out of the way.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Dabble in All Before Unlocking</h1>
            <br>
            It is important to understand that all the classes play slightly differently, even within the same category. Wardens and Raiders might both be Vanguards, but they do play differently.  This makes it important to try out all the classes. Here’s the trick though, you do not have to unlock a class to play it. All unlocking does is allow gear and skill customization.  So play around a bit before deciding which classes you want to unlock.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Gain Some Levels Before Buying Packs</h1>
            <br>
            Speaking of unlocking, hold off on buying backs until you have a few levels in your chosen class. The gear level in the packs is based on your character’s level, so waiting until level 3 or 4 to open packs will get you better gear.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Understand the Modes</h1>
            <br>
            If you are looking for duels, be sure to stick with 1v1. While you will get mostly duels in 2v2 Brawls, 2v1 situations will commonly occur. 4v4 Elimination will be a long running battle with frequent instances of 2v1 and even 3v1. Dominion? Stay out of Dominion if you want to focus on fair fights between players. Killing other players is secondary in this mode, with the focus instead on claiming the control points.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Be Patient</h1>
            <br>
            This game has a high skill ceiling. You will most likely suck and lose horribly at first. Be patient. Take your time, think about why you lost, and try and improve for the next time. Always remember you have the option of practicing against the AI if you feel you’re really stuck.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>The Faction War</h1>
            <br>
            You can contribute to this by fighter players or the AI. If you really don’t want to be bothered, then just fight.  The system will allocate resources automatically. If you do want to control things a bit more, remember to go to the Faction War screen to allocate your war resources after every match.
            <br>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <br>
            <h1>Have Fun</h1>
            <br>
            It is, after all, a game. Enter the field of battle with a courageous heart, and enjoy.
